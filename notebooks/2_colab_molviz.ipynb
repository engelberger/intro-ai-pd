However, its most relevant body of corresponds to the **coordinates** (i.e. the three-dimensional positions) of the atoms of a structure of a given protein.

This information is far from giving you exact atomic coordinates resolutions, thus measurements of how well defined is this coordinate is also written in this format. Those columns, next to the coordinates, are the occupancy and temperature (or B) factors. The occupancy tells you if the atom is definitely in that position, or if an alternative configuration is also likely. The image in **Figure 1** presents this scenario in a protein structure solved by X-ray crystallography (PDB 6ANE; the same we used in Lab.01), where a given tryptophan residue cannot be univocally assigned to a single configuration (i.e. the electron density is equally fit in both configurations). In this case, this is interpreted as if this residue actually _occupies_ both configurations in the crystal, such that nearly half of the molecules in the crystal lattice take one of the conformers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L5e8DTyic7a7"},"source":["<figure>\n","<center>\n","<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/master/images/pdbformat_01.gif'/>\n","<figcaption>FIGURE 1.
